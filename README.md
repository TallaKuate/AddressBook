# AddressBook
RiskFirst â€“ Technical Exercise 

Architecture Summary:

This application is composed of:

1) 3 Microservices: 

---> AddressManager API that will deal with the address functionalities. A Get request is currently implemented for demo: get an address by Id 

---> UserManager API that will deal with the user domain data. A get request is implemented for demo: get a user by Id.

---> And the AddressBook API that will actually manage the user addresses. A get request is implemented: get all user addresses grouped by city. 

2) An API Gateways that gives access to the microservices functionalities. 


An event bus can be used later in order to synchronize the data between the microservices.
